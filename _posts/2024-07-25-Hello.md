<div style="line-height: 1.5;">
I am a Ph.D. Student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in Korea University! My bachelor's degree is Korean language and literature, and I am interested in Korean Natural Language Processing. I sincerely would like to contribute to the Korean NLP community!

My main interest is to do interdisciplinary research with different fields such as linguistics, psychology, sociology, etc. Programming is actually a challenge for me, but I'm trying!! ðŸ˜… Most of my posts will focus on interpreting NLP technology from a humanities perspective.

See you again! >_<
