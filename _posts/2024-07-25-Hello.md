# Welcome

**Hello!** Let me introduce myself! 

![git](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/518f854c-b844-41a2-a599-1bc7a2537ecb)


I am a Ph.D. Student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in Korea University!
My bachelor's degree is Korean language and literature, and I am intereseted in Korean Natural Language Processing. 
I sincerely would like to contribute to the Korean NLP community!
My main interest is to do interdisciplinary research with different fields such as linguistics, psychology, sociology, etc. 
Programming is actually a challenge for me, but I'm trying!! ðŸ˜…
I will be posting mostly about interpreting NLP techonology from a humanities perspective. 
Stay tuned! >_<
